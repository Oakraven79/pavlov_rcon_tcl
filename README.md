# pavlov_rcon_tcl
A small app written in Python Tkinter and asyncio to interface with Pavlov's RCON from within VR.

## Why does this exist?
I wanted to build a tool that I could use to admin Pavlov from within VR but set myself a challenge to use as much vanilla python as possible. So part fun project but also hoping to contribute to what is a really cool game!


There are plenty of tools to manage Pavlov via RCON, check out http://wiki.pavlov-vr.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_server#Tools_available_to_access_Rcon_interface 

## Installation
Step 1. Go to www.python.org/downloads/ and install python 3.8 or above and get it working on your system.

Step 2. Download the code as a zip (`Code` -> `Download zip`)

Step 3. Unzip that file where you want.

Step 4. edit `server.json` and supply the creds for you server

Step 5. either `run_win.bat` or run
